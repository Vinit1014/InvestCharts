# InvestCharts
Hello everyone 👋 ,
I made 📈 InvestCharts 🚀 as a part of my React project.
InvestCharts is a powerful website that allows users to explore and analyze stocks based in the USA, making informed investment decisions easier than ever!

📊 With smooth and interactive chart visualizations powered by Chart.js, InvestCharts provides an intuitive way to view essential financial data such as total current assets, total current liabilities, and more for making any long-term investment decision. No more boring tables!

🔍 Stay informed with the latest news related to your favorite stocks directly on InvestCharts. Our platform fetches real-time news updates to help you make informed decisions.

💡 Built with React, Chart.js, and React Hooks and have used yahoofinance API for fetching data. As they are having a hard limit on the free version, I have not made it public. But if possible will do it in the future.

This project really helped me grasp knowledge of all important react hooks and made by concept more clear. Many more to go.
